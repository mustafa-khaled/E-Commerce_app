# E-Commerce App

This is a full-stack e-commerce application built using React, Firebase, and Stripe. The app provides users with an intuitive and seamless shopping experience, allowing them to browse and purchase products, manage their shopping cart, view their order history, and create a wish list. The app utilizes Firebase for user authentication, ensuring secure access to user-specific features and data.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: The app incorporates Firebase authentication, enabling users to create accounts, login securely, and manage their personal information. This ensures a seamless and personalized shopping experience for each user.

2. **Product Catalog**: Users can explore a wide range of products through an intuitive and responsive user interface. The catalog provides detailed product information, including images, descriptions, and prices.

3. **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart, update quantities, and remove items as needed. The cart dynamically calculates the total price, allowing users to review their selections before proceeding to checkout.

4. **Checkout and Payment**: The app seamlessly integrates Stripe for secure payment processing. Users can enter their billing and shipping information and complete their purchases with confidence, knowing their transactions are protected.

5. **Order History**: Users have access to their order history, providing them with a record of past purchases. They can view details of each order, such as order status, items purchased, and delivery information.

6. **Wish List**: Users can create a wish list to save their favorite products for future reference. This feature allows users to easily track and revisit products they are interested in without having to search through the entire catalog.
